        <p>As a cereal grain, domesticated rice is the most widely consumed staple food for over half of the world's human population, especially in Asia and Africa. 
          It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize.
        </p>
        
        <p>[1] Since sizable portions of sugarcane and maize crops are used for purposes other than human consumption, 
          rice is the most important food crop with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, 
          providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans.
        </p>
        
        <p>[2] There are many varieties of rice and culinary preferences tend to vary regionally.
          Oryza sativa with small wind-pollinated flowers
          The traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound irrigation planning but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters vermin.
          While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice,
          all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.

        <P> The varieties of rice are typically classified as long-, medium-, and short-grained.
          </p>
         <P> [4] The grains of long-grain rice (high in amylose) tend to remain intact after cooking; medium-grain rice (high in amylopectin) becomes more sticky.
             Medium-grain rice is used for sweet dishes, for risotto in Italy, and many rice dishes, such as arròs negre, in Spain. Some varieties of long-grain rice that are high in amylopectin, known as Thai Sticky rice, are usually steamed.
            [5] A stickier short-grain rice is used for sushi;
            [6] the stickiness allows rice to hold its shape when cooked.
            [7] Short-grain rice is used extensively in Japan,
            [8] including to accompany savoury dishes.
            [9] Short-grain rice is often used for rice pudding.
            Instant rice differs from parboiled rice in that it is fully cooked and then dried, though there is a significant degradation in taste and texture.
            Rice flour and starch often are used in batters and breadings to increase crispiness. Want to know more click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice">learn more.

          <h2>Curry</h2>
        </nav>
          <p> Burmese curry refers to a diverse array of dishes in Burmese cuisine that consist of protein or vegetables simmered or stewed in an curry base of aromatics.
          </p>
          <p> [1] Burmese curries generally differ from other Southeast Asian curries (e.g., Thai curry) in that Burmese curries make use of dried spices in addition to fresh herbs and aromatics, and are often milder.
          [2] Burmese curries are readily available in curry houses throughout the country. 
        <p>    They are traditionally accompanied with rice and a variety of side dishes, soup, and Burmese salads called athoke. 
          Burmese curries may also be paired with flatbreads like nanbya, palata, aloo puri, and toshay.</p>
        </p>
        
        <h id="ingredients"> <ins>Ingredients</ins> </h>
      
        <p>A curry base of fresh onions, shallots, garlic, chilis, ginger, and turmeric powder is typically used to prepare most Burmese curries.
          [3] Dried spices such as paprika, chili powder, spice mixes like garam masala (generically called masala in Burmese) also feature in many Burmese curries.
          [1][3] Some Burmese curries also require the use of fresh herbs, such as lemongrass, curry leaf, pyindawthein, and fresh tamarind paste. Shan and Kachin curries make more liberal use of fresh herbs such as galangal and sawtooth coriander.
          [1] Burmese curries are generally seasoned using fish sauce, salt, or ngapi (fermented shrimp or fish paste), and are traditionally cooked in a blend of peanut oil and sesame oil.

        <p> It’s hard to go hungry while walking the streets of Yangon or Mandalay. Assuming you don’t mind fish soup from a cart, that is
          <b>MOHINGA.</b></p>
        
        <p> Regarded as Myanmar’s national dish and prolific across the country, mohinga is a fish soup made with rice noodles.
          The exact recipe varies based on regional tastes and ingredients, but you’ll find a typical version in the country’s south,
          where fresh fish abounds.
          To form the rich and hardy broth, vendors combine chickpea flour with a host of vegetables and seasoning, including onions, lemongrass, garlic, ginger and banana tree stem, then cook it in fish sauce. 
          After combining the stew with rice vermicelli,
          the dish can be topped with an array of optional additions, including crispy fritters, chickpeas or a boiled egg—meaning each bowl of mohinga, like each individual experience in Myanmar, is completely unique.
        </p>
        
        <p>Sold by street hawkers and roadside stalls, Myanmar city streets are rife with mohinga.
          The original purveyors of Myanmar’s de facto national dish roam the streets, developing regular customers in certain neighbourhoods—and returning often once the relationship is established.

    <p> Mont lin maya (Burmese: မုန့်လင်မယား) is a traditional Burmese street snack or mont.
              The Burmese name literally means "husband and wife snack",and is also known as mont ok galay (မုန့်အုပ်ကလေး, lit. 'little covered snack') or mont maung hnan (မုန့်မောင်နှံ, lit. 'couple snack')
              in Mawlamyine and Upper Myanmar.
              The dish consists of crisp, round savory pancakes made with a batter consisting of rice flour, quail eggs, chickpeas, and spring onions, fried in a special metal pan.
